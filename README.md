Voice Extraction for Biometric Authentication

Overview:
This project focuses on voice extraction, a vital component in biometric authentication systems. Voice extraction involves processing raw audio signals to isolate unique voice features that enable accurate speaker identification and verification.

Key Features:
Audio Preprocessing: Noise reduction, silence removal, and normalization for clean input data.

Framing & Windowing: Dividing audio into small frames with window functions to prepare for feature extraction.

Feature Extraction: Using techniques like MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) to capture distinctive voice characteristics.

Robust to Noise: Implements methods to minimize the impact of background noise and channel variation.

Compact Feature Representation: Converts audio into fixed-length feature vectors for use in machine learning models.
